- Updated to version 3.3.2.1
- Update Tasks kill-list for Gpg4Win v3.3.2
  https://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=gpg4win.git;a=blob;f=src/installer.nsi;hb=refs/tags/gpg4win-3.3.2#l400
- Update to remove-list of socket named-pipes in user profile-dir
- X.509-Certstore updated.

20250625

- Updated to version 3.3.2.0
- Now GpgTools 3.3.2.0 will support Gpg4Win 3.1.16 AND Gpg4Win 3.3.2.0
- Update GpgOL to 2.6.0.5155
- Update GnuPG to 2.2.47 (digital-signed)
- Removed crl-checks in config-profiles under
  "GnuPG\share\doc\gnupg\examples\*.prf":
  Removed [gpgsm] section from profiles because it
  was also removed in "GnuPG VS Desktop" and
  "enable-crl-checks" seems to be hard-coded now in gpgsm
  by "libgpgme" in "qgpgmerefreshsmimekeysjob.cpp" line 119:
  mProcess->setObjectName(QStringLiteral("gpgsm -k --with-validation --force-crl-refresh --enable-crl-checks"));

- Added additional directories for replacement during update in
  [InstallDelete]-section in order to avoid leaving orphaned files
  behind.
- Updated to version 3.2.2.1

20240621

- Version-naming scheme changed to Gpg4Win-naming scheme.
- Now GpgTools 3.2.2 will support Gpg4Win 3.1.16 + Gpg4Win 3.2.2
  and Gpg4Win 4.3.1 !!
- Full VS-NfD documentation installed.
- Fix versioning of .mo installation-sequence for gpgol.dll-update
- GpgOL-Update to 2.5.12 for Gpg4Win 3.1.16.
- GnuPG-Update to 2.2.43 (original digital-signed) for Gpg4Win 3.1.16.
- Update OpenSSL to selfbuild (mingw winlibs-build) 3.1.5.
- Automatic X.509-Certstore-Updater "BuildTrustList.bat" is now
  using Mozilla-default branch ROOT-STORE and is also indexing
  "extra-certs"-store.
- "BuildTrustList.bat" now supports downloads behind a well defined
  proxy/firewall.
- "BuildTrustList.bat" will now do a pre-download-check before
  cert-deletion (when updating cert-db); only when the test was
  successful, the root cert-db will be deleted and reinitialized by
  an updated Mozilla cert-db.
- Due to false positives on some AV-engines (checked by VirusTotal)
  the AutoIT-tools "StartCon", "MigrateGnuPGKeybase" and
  "ExpandGNUPGHOME" were re-compiled to "a3x"-binaries in order to
  disable the AutoIT PE-loader usage of AutoIT-exe files. Their
  execution is now performed by the "autoit32.exe" and "autoit64.exe"
  runtime-systems, that were slightly modified in their resources
  (changed icon and file-description). In order to prevent Windows
  from a signature-check-error (due to changed resources), i removed
  their digital PE-signature by "AutoIt Consulting Ltd", that was
  expired anyway in 20230804.
- Update Bass-Lib for installer-sound to 2.4.17.0. I also fixed an
  initialization-problem with Bass 2.4.17.x, due to an error i did
  before, that was not triggered by basslib < 2.4.17. I did not fully
  defined "BASS_Init flags" (used: "0" here). Now in version 2.4.17.0
  i have to provide for "DirectSound" "BASS_DEVICE_DSOUND" as value
  of "$40000" and not "0" (which is NOT DEFINED here) !!
- Fixed an error in Pascal-code, where i did an "Abort" in an
  exception-handling (not a good idea ;-( ...), so the installer
  could hung, when no Gpg4Win was installed.

20230612

- X.509-Certstore (based on Mozilla ROOT-Store) updated.

  https://github.com/landsh-de/VBDownloader/releases/tag/v1.2.0.0
- "BuildTrustList.bat" (update ROOT-Certs from Mozilla ROOT-Store)

  https://dev.gnupg.org/T4127
  https://dev.gnupg.org/rOdd3ff8397aaf62e58fa9405ddc5397cb6bcfdc29
   
20230106

- X.509-Certstore updated.
- German certs from BSI, Bundeswehr, V-PKI, DOI, Telesec and
  Dataport added to "extra-certs".
- ROOT certs from Mozilla ROOT certstore (only trusted-versions)
  added to "trusted-certs".
- Scripts for ROOT-CertStore-Update and cert-test updated.
- Central GnuPG-config cleanup and synchronized with config from
  "GnuPG VS Desktop" 3.1.26. Keyserver now defined only in
  "dirmngr.conf".
- Update Version to GpgTools 1.3.26.1 / 1.4.1.1

20221225

- Bump version update to support GnuPG 2.2.41 / Gpg4Win 3.1.26
  and GnuPG 2.4.0 / Gpg4Win 4.1.0.
  
  The included GnuPG-Package (original installer) was updated
  to 2.2.41. Important fixes:
  
  - Fix CVE-2022-3515 (https://dev.gnupg.org/T6230) and
    CVE-2022-47629 (https://dev.gnupg.org/T6284)

  - For detailed release-infos of GnuPG 2.2.41 see:
    https://dev.gnupg.org/T6280

20221106

- Tiny fix in updating a GnuPG 2.3.xx.x version. Definitely remove
  additional 2.3 special files, when updating 2.3 with a 2.2-
  installer. The 2.2-uninstaller will do not remove these files:
  
    - "{code:GetGnuPG2Installed}\bin\gpg-card.exe"
    - "{code:GetGnuPG2Installed}\bin\keyboxd.exe"

- Added "gpg-card.exe" and "keyboxd.exe" to "Tasks"-objects
  for process-kill at startup.

20221104

- Bump version to 1.3.25.1 / 1.4.04.0
- Added "gpg.exe" version check in order to support different backends
  in dependency of "Gpg4Win".
- Added english "BSI SecOPs" files for documentation.
- Updated OpenSSL to openssl-1.1.1s and zlib to zlib-1.2.13.
- We have now support for Gpg4Win 4.0.x.
- With GpgTools 1.4.04.x it is now possible to install also a hardened
  de-vs conformant VS-NfD-configuration (like GpgTools 1.3.xx.x for
  Gpg4Win 3.1.xx) for Gpg4Win 4.0.x by replacing the GnuPG-backend
  with the latest GnuPG 2.2.xx version (no warnings by kleopatra about
  a non VS-NfD-conformant GnuPG-version anymore).
  
  Pay attention: "kleopatra.exe" has still a file-version-info string
  of "3.1.24.0"
  
20221025

- Bump version to 1.3.25.0 in order to reflect Gpg4Win version-update
  to 3.1.25.0. Pay attention: "kleopatra.exe" has still a
  file-version-info string of "3.1.24.0"
  
- Local X.509 ROOT-CERTS disabled.
  Due to a lot of X.509-cert files under ...
  "ProgramData\GNU\etc\gnupg\extra-certs" and ...
  "ProgramData\GNU\etc\gnupg\trusted-certs", with a configurated
  "trustlist.txt"-file, i recognized an extreme long running task
  when running "kleopatra" or "gpgol" for the first time of ...
  gpg, gpg-agent, and scdaemon. The reason are cert-checks for
  all pub-certs under the directories, mentioned above !!
  
  THIS MAY RESULT IN A TIMEOUT-ERROR OF GPGOL OR KLEOPATRA !!
  
  So i disabled this trust-mechanism and moved all certs to
  "ProgramData\GNU\etc\gnupg\deactivated\". This was only a test
  for the feasibility of integrating trusted ROOT-CERTS from
  serveral ROOT-CAs with an automatic update-mechanism.
  
- Added "gpg-connect-agent.exe" and "gpg-wks-client.exe" to
  user-based process-termination tool "Gpg4Win_beenden.exe".
  
- Updated NSIS-Installer Package to GnuPG 2.2.40.11935 (10.10.2022).
  Original name: "gnupg-w32-2.2.40_20221010.exe" (original signed)

- Fixed removal of file "trustlist_err.txt".

20220912

- Bump installer version to 1.3.24.0 in order to reflect version
  update of Gpg4Win and support Gpg4Win 3.1.24.0. Pay attention:
  "kleopatra.exe" has now a file-version-info string of "3.1.24.0".

20220906

- Updated integrated NSIS-Installer Package to
  GnuPG 2.2.39.31776 (02.09.2022) Original name:
  "gnupg-w32-2.2.39_20220902.exe" (original signed by Werner Koch)
  Release-Info: https://dev.gnupg.org/T6175

- Fixed zlib 1.2.12 with 2 patches for CVE-2022-37434 in my
  openssl 1.1.1q-build. OpenSSL is used by the x.509-cert
  update-script: "BuildTrustList.bat" in central master
  config-directory: "%ProgramData%\GNU\etc\gnupg".
  For details read "openssl.txt" in the same directory.
  For security-reasons, my "openssl.exe"-build is using a modified
  "Manifest", that allows its execution only under admin-rights.

- Bump Installer version to 1.3.23.1 in order to reflect
  GnuPG version-update.

20220830

20220708

- Update Installer:
  Added support for two versions of gpg4win and their file-dependencies.
  Depending on detected version (3.1.16 or 3.x.xx), different
  fixed files may now be installed by evaluation of the two
  functions: Check: Is3116() / Check: Is31XX().

- Update GnuPG v2.2.36 (security-update, improvements)
  Release-Info: https://dev.gnupg.org/T5949
