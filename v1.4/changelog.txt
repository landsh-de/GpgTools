- Bump version to 1.3.25.1 / 1.4.04.0
- Added "gpg.exe" version check in order to support different backends
  in dependency of "Gpg4Win".
- Added english "BSI SecOPs" files for documentation.
- Updated OpenSSL to openssl-1.1.1s and zlib to zlib-1.2.13.
- We have now support for Gpg4Win 4.0.x.
- With GpgTools 1.4.04.x it is now possible to install also a hardened
  de-vs conformant VS-NfD-configuration (like GpgTools 1.3.xx.x for
  Gpg4Win 3.1.xx) for Gpg4Win 4.0.x by replacing the GnuPG-backend
  with the latest GnuPG 2.2.xx version (no warnings by kleopatra about
  a non VS-NfD-conformant GnuPG-version anymore).
  
  Pay attention: "kleopatra.exe" has still a file-version-info string
  of "3.1.24.0"

- Bump version to 1.3.25.0 in order to reflect Gpg4Win version-update
  to 3.1.25.0. Pay attention: "kleopatra.exe" has still a
  file-version-info string of "3.1.24.0"
  
- Local X.509 ROOT-CERTS disabled.
  Due to a lot of X.509-cert files under ...
  "ProgramData\GNU\etc\gnupg\extra-certs" and ...
  "ProgramData\GNU\etc\gnupg\trusted-certs", with a configurated
  "trustlist.txt"-file, i recognized an extreme long running task
  when running "kleopatra" or "gpgol" for the first time of ...
  gpg, gpg-agent, and scdaemon. The reason are cert-checks for
  all pub-certs under the directories, mentioned above !!
  
  THIS MAY RESULT IN A TIMEOUT-ERROR OF GPGOL OR KLEOPATRA !!
  
  So i disabled this trust-mechanism and moved all certs to
  "ProgramData\GNU\etc\gnupg\deactivated\". This was only a test
  for the feasibility of integrating trusted ROOT-CERTS from
  serveral ROOT-CAs with an automatic update-mechanism.
  
- Added "gpg-connect-agent.exe" and "gpg-wks-client.exe" to
  user-based process-termination tool "Gpg4Win_beenden.exe".
  
- Updated NSIS-Installer Package to GnuPG 2.2.40.11935 (10.10.2022).
  Original name: "gnupg-w32-2.2.40_20221010.exe" (original signed)

- Fixed removal of file "trustlist_err.txt".

- Bump installer version to 1.3.24.0 in order to reflect version
  update of Gpg4Win and support Gpg4Win 3.1.24.0. Pay attention:
  "kleopatra.exe" has now a file-version-info string of "3.1.24.0".

- Updated integrated NSIS-Installer Package to
  GnuPG 2.2.39.31776 (02.09.2022) Original name:
  "gnupg-w32-2.2.39_20220902.exe" (original signed by Werner Koch)
  Release-Info: https://dev.gnupg.org/T6175

- Fixed zlib 1.2.12 with 2 patches for CVE-2022-37434 in my
  openssl 1.1.1q-build. OpenSSL is used by the x.509-cert
  update-script: "BuildTrustList.bat" in central master
  config-directory: "%ProgramData%\GNU\etc\gnupg".
  For details read "openssl.txt" in the same directory.
  For security-reasons, my "openssl.exe"-build is using a modified
  "Manifest", that allows its execution only under admin-rights.

- Bump Installer version to 1.3.23.1 in order to reflect
  GnuPG version-update.

- Update Installer:
  Added support for two versions of gpg4win and their file-dependencies.
  Depending on detected version (3.1.16 or 3.x.xx), different
